I'm also currently working as icehockeyreferee and as a statistical operator in SHL. Work as a referee are a tough job, because players and leaders demand that I'm a good leader and perform on top. Every game.
<p></p>
It also requires a mental calm and a good physical status. As a statistical operator, I work on Örebro hockey's home games in the secretariat. There I do the communication with the referees and make sure that the speaker, jombotrone and penaltybox get the right information. As a person, I am used to working in a group, but also with my own overall responsibility. I am very committed and have a high working ethic.

Others see me as a curious person with an interest in finding new things to learn. I am used to working under stress when I am often under pressure in my domicile, which forces me to make quick decisions.
<p></p>
I'm not afraid to face new challenges as I know it will develop me as a developer and human being. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to telling you more about myself at a personal meeting with you.

Sincerely
